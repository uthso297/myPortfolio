                        I began my programming journey with the C language. During my first semester at the university&apos;s Software Engineering Department, I recognized C as the &quot;mother language&quot; of programming. Mastering it would provide a solid foundation, making it easier to transition to other languages.

                        After gaining proficiency in C and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), I shifted my focus to web development. Through Programming Hero, I explored the MERN stack, beginning with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I then expanded my skills to include React and backend technologies such as Node.js and Express. Over time, I became proficient in building full-stack MERN applications.
                        <br />
                        This journey was challenging, with many ups and downs, but I continuously pushed my limits to develop my skills and achieve my goal of becoming a capable developer. In addition to acquiring technical skills, I earned a CGPA of 3.88, demonstrating my dedication and commitment.
                        In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and dedicating time to my family, who have always been an important source of support.
